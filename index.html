<p>Welcome to my little corner of the web focused on beauty self care! Looking after your mind, body and soul is so important for true beauty.</p> 

<p>I believe self care goes far beyond just skincare routines and makeup tips. It's about nurturing yourself from the inside out through mindfulness, healthy habits and practicing self love.</p>

<p>On this blog I share my favorite ways to take time for me, reduce stress, feel confident and glow from within.</p>

<p>I hope my posts about yoga, meditation, healthy recipes, affirmations, aromatherapy, journaling and more inspire you to treat yourself with care and kindness!</p>

<p>Let's connect on social for more beauty and wellness inspiration:</p>

<p>I'm an aspiring cloud solutions architect currently based in Seattle. I love staying on top of the latest developments in cloud computing - things like serverless architectures, containers, and machine learning on the cloud really excite me!</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source cloud projects, hiking, photography, and reading sci-fi novels. I also love attending cloud computing conferences and events so I can keep learning.</p>
